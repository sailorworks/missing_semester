This is my understanding or you can say, my documentation of what I've learnt in this course.
Here are some tips for efficiently going through lecture notes on GitHub:

Use the table of contents: Many repositories have a table of contents that can help you quickly navigate to the section you need.

Use the search function: You can use the search function within a repository to find specific keywords or topics.

Take advantage of markdown formatting: Many lecture notes on GitHub are written in markdown, which allows for easy formatting and organization. Pay attention to headings, lists, and other formatting to quickly find the information you need.

Clone the repository: If you want to have offline access to the lecture notes or if you want to make your own notes and annotations, consider cloning the repository to your local machine.

I hope these tips help you efficiently go through lecture notes on GitHub!
